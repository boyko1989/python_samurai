## How You Can Contribute

If you want to start contributing to open source, then Python is a great project to start with. You’ll not only be making your mark on one of the biggest projects out there, but you’ll also be doing it as part of a vibrant and welcoming community. Open source projects rely on contributions from volunteers like you to grow and evolve, so you’ll be making a real difference to the future of open source software.

On top of that, contributing to open source is a great way to learn and build your skills, so don’t worry if you don’t feel like an expert. There may be a way to contribute that’s perfect for you, even if you don’t know about it yet. It all starts with your first contribution!

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll know:

+ How you can contribute in a way that matches your skills and interests
+ What resources and tools you can use to help you contribute confidently
+ Where you can find ideas for fixes to propose in your first contribution

## How to Get the Resources You’ll Need

When you start contributing to an open source project, there can be a lot of information to take in all at once.

To help you navigate it all, your first port of call should be the Python Developer’s Guide. It’s a super important resource that all contributors and core developers rely on since it covers everything from how to assess a potential contribution to how to deal will issue tracking. (If you contribute to this guide, then you’ll be able to make a big impact on what contributing to Python is like.)

Once you get down to the nuts and bolts of contributing, it’ll be useful to get familiar with a few tools:

+ **GitHub**: Python contributors collaborate with each other through GitHub, which allows you to host code, do version control, give feedback, and more. To learn more about how to use this tool, check out Introduction to Git and GitHub for Python Developers as well as Python’s official Git Bootcamp and Cheat Sheet.

+ **reStructuredText:** If you want to contribute documentation, then it’ll be very helpful to learn how to use this markup language. The Python Developer’s Guide has a primer on reStructuredText to help you get started. (Fun fact: reStructuredText has been around longer than Markdown!)

+ **Sphinx:** You’ll use Sphinx to build Python’s documentation. To learn more, you can check out Mariatta Wijaya’s talk Introduction to Sphinx Docs and reStructuredText and Eric Holscher’s talk Documenting your project with Sphinx & Read the Docs.

Although you don’t need to have experience with the C programming language to contribute to Python, it can open up some new ways of contributing. Here are some resources you can check out to learn more:

+ C for Python Programmers
+ Your Guide to the CPython Source Code
+ CPython Internals: Your Guide to the Python 3 Interpreter

To get a feel for how the interpersonal aspects of contributing to Python work, you can also check out Brett Canon’s PyCascades talk Setting Expectations for Open Source Participation. It’s about setting reasonable expectations of each other so we can make open source pleasant for everyone involved.
